# RLOX 

This is an implementation of the lox programming language, following [crafting interpreters](www.craftinginterpreters.com) . 

This is being done as a project to increase my Rust learning as well to increase my understanding of 
languages implementations in general. The code is not perfect by any means and open to suggestions.

Right now, the most tested part is the `REPL`, which works by just running cargo run on the terminal. 

I'll try to keep the README update to date in what part of the book I'm on. 

Working on:  [II.9 - Control Flow](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/control-flow.html)
